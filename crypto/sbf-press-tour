# SBF's Press Tour

I think it's best to pay minimal attention to the SBF/FTX implosion as there isn't much I can do about it and the consequences of the blow up will not change my mind about the importance of DeFi + crypto in the world. That said, it is a fascinating spectacle and tragedy. As a result, it's hard not to watch the slow-motion car wreck unfolding off the coast of Florida as we speak.

## Straussian Readings

First, I want to note something about the intended audience of SBF's press tour. I instinctively listen to SBF's interviews as if he is speaking directly to the crytpo community / CT. But that is clearly not the case, and it may be useful to enumerate the potential audiences in SBF's mind as he speaks:

- Prosecutors: SBF must be careful not to incriminate himself
- Depositors: SBF probably wants to avoid scapegoating, and the best way to do that is to "own" up to what he's done while not really doing so
- Investors: FTX was a legitimate business, and SBF, if given the opportunity, would very much try to rebuild it
- Crypto Twitter: the least important group in this list

Overall, I think SBF and Jeff Skilling have a lot in common. When Enron went bust, Jeff Skilling defended himself to the very end (he even testified in his own trial). This is likely the result of a combination of narcissism/psychopathy and a genuine belief in FTX. Later on, Skilling acknowledged that he made a mistake in testifying. (Source: Acquired podcast, Enron episode).

## What can we learn?

I don't think there is a ton to learn from SBF at this point. The funds are missing, and even if he knew where they were, the best people for him to inform at this point would be John Ray. Even the blatant self-contradictions are only really useful to the prosecution of his fraud. Other than that, I don't think there's anything useful to hear from SBF.

### Side note: so much for effective altruism

I find it very funny that SBF now is stating that he has a "duty" to depositors to keep them informed. Does not sound like he is optimizing for the greatest good but rather is speaking from some fundamental source of duty. Very fast change from his prior utilitarian perspective.

## Beliefs

- SBF is probably a psychopath solely interested in self preservation (this theory will be imminently testable when his lieutenants turn against him)
- SBF's media tour is an example of narcissism where he is ignoring the advice of his extremely qualified legal team because he thinks he can charm his way through the justice system
- It will take a while to collect the facts and arrest SBF. That said, I do expect that FTX/Alameda's top executives will see some jail time (like 5-10 years, just like Enron)

That's it for now. We can check back in 15 years or something to see what actually happened.
