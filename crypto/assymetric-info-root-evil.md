# Transparent Collateral Maximalism

**Belief: Asymmetric information is a key ingredient in the proliferation of credit busts. In order for lenders to become willing to accept weaker forms of collateral, there needs to be a discrepency in the lenders' understanding of what the collateral is. In order to succeed in the future, DeFi needs to make sure its credit protocols continue to rely on transparent collateral.**

## Opacity vs. Transparency

It wasn't possible to understand the "daisy chain" of credit that Barry Silbert referred to in his [tweet](https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/1408191462324441092?lang=en). At its core, trad-fi credit is opaque. Regulators must watch the credit market to keep it functioning properly and for the benefit of the economy. Asymmetric information can also be understood as a form of counterparty risk; the collateral in the daisy chain is worthless, but because the lenders aren't aware of that, they get washed when borrowers are unable to repay their debts.

DeFi solves this by making collateral both transparent. Credit creation in crypto relies on programmed, automated forms of collateral in smart contracts, and in doing so, eliminates the possiblity of deceiving lenders into accepting poor collateral (smart contract bugs & social engineering notwithstanding).

## Collateral Frontiers in DeFi Credit

DeFi's next core function will be enabling the formation of credit that relies on non-fungible sources of collateral.

Debt is fundamentally non-fungible. For example, while mortgages are all similar, because they are collateralized by different houses, they are also fundamentally non-fungible. For DeFi to grow, it will have to enable the formation of unique forms of collateral creation. 

Currently, [Bend](https://www.benddao.xyz/en/) has implemented a peer-to-pool lending  protocol for NFTs. Similarly, [NFTfi](https://www.nftfi.com/) has created peer-to-peer lending protocol.

These protocols continue the DeFi tradition of providing transparent collateral. Because of the nature of smart contracts and NFT markets, it isn't possible to deceive someone into accepting a poorly collateralized loan within NFT lending markets.

Here are some potential sources of collateral that I could seeing coming online in the coming years:

1. DAO treasuries
2. Future NFT creations
3. Tokenized RWA (very far away, backdoor to opaque credit?)
4. Insurance funds?
5. ???


## Conclusion

Finding new ways to generate transparent collateral on-chain will make crypto-native organizations more efficient. There is a long way to go. Today, only the most liquid assets can be used as collateral, and rightfully so. By building protocols that rely on transparent, pristine collateral, DeFi stands to create a resilient marketplace that is productive and accessible to both borrowers and lenders alike.

In the end, DeFi cannot stop fraud, deceit and human emotion from getting in the way of euphoria and despair. Ultimately, credit cycles are driven by human emotion. Cycles are not going anywhere. However, we can build infrastructure to contrain ourselves to make the prudent decision. Just as Homer had his crew tie him to a pole as they passed the Sirens, DeFi can enable lending markets that use transparent collateral to limit the excesses of credit cycles.
