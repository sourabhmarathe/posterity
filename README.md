## Why Git(Hub)?

When considering the options for a blog, the simplest option for a blogging platform is a good old fashioned GitHub repo. Most of the learning curve with using a GitHub repo for blogging is learning how to use `git` which I am already familiar with. There are lots of benefits to this model:

- good middle ground between local and cloud hosted storage
- automatic UI + styling via `.md` formatting syntax
- easy to preview posts by using extensions in VSCode
- easy to maintain
